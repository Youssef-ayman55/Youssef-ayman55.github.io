I am an undergraduate student at **The American University in Cairo**, pursuing a B.Sc. in **Computer Engineering and Mathematics** (GPA: **4.00/4.00**). My interests lie in **algorithmic design, geometry processing, and physics-based simulation**, with an emphasis on building efficient, mathematically grounded systems.

I am particularly drawn to problems at the intersection of **theory and implementation**, where numerical methods, data structures, and performance-critical code meet real-world applications.
